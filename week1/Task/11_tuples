## 🧠 **What is a Tuple in Python?**

A **tuple** is an **ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection of items**. Tuples are similar to lists but **cannot be modified** after creation.

---

### 📚 **Definition:**

> A **tuple** in Python is a **collection of ordered, indexed, and immutable elements**, defined using parentheses `()`.

---

### 🔍 **Tuple Syntax:**

```python
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)
```

### 📌 **Key Characteristics of Tuples:**

| Feature                          | Description                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Ordered**                      | Elements have a fixed position/index           |
| **Immutable**                    | Cannot change values after creation            |
| **Indexed**                      | Access elements using indices like `tuple[0]`  |
| **Allows Duplicates**            | Yes, tuples can store duplicate values         |
| **Can be Nested**                | Tuples can contain other tuples or collections |
| **Can Contain Mixed Data Types** | (e.g., integers, strings, floats)              |

### 🧩 **Tuple vs List (Comparison Chart)**

| Feature     | Tuple                    | List                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Brackets    | `()`                     | `[]`                         |
| Mutability  | Immutable                | Mutable                      |
| Performance | Faster                   | Slower                       |
| Use case    | Fixed data               | Dynamic data                 |
| Methods     | Fewer (`count`, `index`) | More (`append`, `pop`, etc.) |

## 📈 Tuple Diagram (Visual Structure)

```plaintext
my_tuple = (1, "Python", 3.14)

Index:     0        1         2
          ┌───┐   ┌───────┐  ┌────┐
Tuple →  ( 1 ,   "Python", 3.14 )
```

---

## ✅ **How to Create a Tuple:**

```python
# Empty Tuple
t1 = ()

# Tuple with multiple items
t2 = (1, 2, 3)

# Mixed data types
t3 = (10, "AI", 3.14)

# Nested tuple
t4 = (1, (2, 3), ["a", "b"])
```

---

## 🔧 **Accessing Tuple Elements:**

```python
t = (100, 200, 300)

print(t[0])     # 100
print(t[-1])    # 300
```

---

## 🔁 **Tuple Operations:**

```python
t = (1, 2, 3)

# Length
print(len(t))  # 3

# Concatenation
print(t + (4, 5))  # (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Repetition
print(t * 2)  # (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3)

# Membership
print(2 in t)  # True
```

---

## 🧮 **Tuple Methods:**

```python
t = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)

print(t.count(2))   # 2
print(t.index(3))   # 3
```

---

## ⚠️ Why Are Tuples Immutable?

- **Data Safety**: Used when data must not be changed.
- **Hashable**: Can be used as dictionary keys.
- **Performance**: Faster due to immutability.

---

## 🔐 **Tuple as Dictionary Key:**

```python
location = {(28.61, 77.23): "Delhi"}

print(location[(28.61, 77.23)])  # Delhi
```

---

## 🔁 Looping Through a Tuple:

```python
t = ("Python", "Java", "C++")
for lang in t:
    print(lang)
```

---

## 🔄 Tuple Packing and Unpacking:

```python
# Packing
t = ("Prashanshi", 21, "Python")

# Unpacking
name, age, lang = t
print(name)  # Prashanshi
```

## 🧠 Tuple Interview Use-Cases:

| Scenario                  | Tuple Use |
| ------------------------- | --------- |
| Returning multiple values | ✅        |
| Immutable configuration   | ✅        |
| Looping performance       | ✅        |
| Preventing modifications  | ✅        |
| Key in dictionary         | ✅        |

---

## 🎯 Summary Points:

- Tuples use `()`, Lists use `[]`
- Tuples are **immutable**, safer for fixed data
- **Faster** than lists in iteration
- Only two built-in methods: `count()`, `index()`
- Can be nested and contain various data types
- Used in **function returns**, **coordinates**, **data integrity**

# ✅ Exercise 4: Concatenate two tuples
t1 = (1, 2, 3)
t2 = (4, 5)
result = t1 + t2
print(result)
# Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

### 💬 Interview-Style Questions:

1. **What are tuples in Python? How are they different from lists?**
   ✅ Tuples are immutable collections of ordered elements. Lists are mutable.

2. **Can a tuple contain a mutable object like a list?**
   ✅ Yes. While tuples themselves are immutable, they can contain mutable objects like lists.

3. **When would you use a tuple over a list?**
   ✅ Use tuples when the data should not change (e.g., coordinates, RGB values, config settings).

4. **How do you unpack a tuple in Python?**

   ```python
   a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
   ```

5. **Is it possible to sort a tuple?**
   ✅ Not directly. You must convert it to a list:

   ```python
   sorted_tuple = tuple(sorted(my_tuple))
   ```
